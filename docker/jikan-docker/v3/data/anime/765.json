Special #3 doesn't fit very well in-between any of the main series, and is more of a side-story.","background":null,"premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{"Parent story":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Chou Henshin Cosprayers","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/112\/Chou_Henshin_Cosprayers"}],"Sequel":[{"mal_id":275,"type":"anime","name":"Love\u2665Love?","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/275\/Love\u2665Love"},{"mal_id":705,"type":"anime","name":"Chou Henshin Cosprayers vs. Ankoku Uchuu Shougun the Movie","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/705\/Chou_Henshin_Cosprayers_vs_Ankoku_Uchuu_Shougun_the_Movie"}],"Alternative version":[{"mal_id":964,"type":"anime","name":"Hit wo Nerae!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/964\/Hit_wo_Nerae"},{"mal_id":1741,"type":"anime","name":"Hit wo Nerae!
