The apples sold by the old are big and red, and the apples sold by the young look good. In fact, there are many holes. With a kind face, customers gradually flocked to the old man's booth. In order to sell the apples, the young man lowered the price and re-placed the apples, showing only the good side. This really attracted many customers. When the two returned home by ferry after doing business, the young people tried to take advantage of the old people everywhere. When the ferry was interrupted by a rush of waves, the two and the boatman fell into the water. The old man felt that the purse was too heavy and discarded it. The young man hurriedly picked it up regardless of his life.(source:douban)","background":"This anime aired in 1990.","premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"}],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"}],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[]}
