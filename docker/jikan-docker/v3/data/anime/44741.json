They met at the Mecha Army Academy and soon became good friends. Several people first got to know hereditary, and then participated in the supply mission of Fengyan and Captain Ming, and met Captain Ming and other front-line combatants who everyone admired. Everyone was very excited, but the original safe supply mission was attacked by the echelon's generals such as the emperor and Lipton. Fengyan fought back in order to protect the cadets. The Second Fleet was almost annihilated. \u3000\u3000The senior frog clan was dissatisfied with the defeat. Captain Ming took all the responsibilities on himself, and he shed tears for Fengyan's sacrifice. The high-levels are preparing to form the second fleet again, and the cadets headed by the steel beasts and others have also accepted the award and formally incorporated into the AIU commando team and become Captain Ming's generals. This is what they dream of. At the same time, the two brothers Shangguan Wolf and Shangguan Eagle, who were hunted down by the invaders, made amazing progress after entering the military academy, and they accidentally saw the crystallization of the frog clan's most advanced ship technology-the fishbone assault ship. The frogs are brewing a major self-defense counterattack...
