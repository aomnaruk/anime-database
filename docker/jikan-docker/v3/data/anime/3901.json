Three years later, Graham is infuriated upon learning that Ladd was pushed off the train after the events aboard the Flying Pussyfoot. As a man of bizarre yet passionate philosophies, he plans to make an offering to Ladd by kidnapping Eve Genoard and subsequently capturing Jacuzzi Splot, who has been living in the Genoard mansion with his gang. Meanwhile, Jacuzzi and his gang take in an unfamiliar woman, Elmer C. Albatross pays a visit to the prison to meet an old friend, and Czeslaw Meyer runs into the man he hoped he would never see again. These seemingly separate storylines merge, tying up several loose ends and revealing the whole truth of the anomaly that occurred aboard the Advena Avis in 1711. [Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"The Baccano! Specials are based on 1931 The Grand Punk Railroad Revisited, a bonus novel that came with the Baccano! drama CD The Grand Punk Railroad. The bonus novel was later expanded into 1931 Another Junk Railroad, the 14th novel of the main light novel series.","premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{"Adaptation":[{"mal_id":1342,"type":"manga","name":"Baccano!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1342\/Baccano"}],"Prequel":[{"mal_id":2251,"type":"anime","name":"Baccano!","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2251\/Baccano"}]},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/17\/Aniplex"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/493\/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/112\/Brains_Base"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"}],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.baccano.jp\/"},{"name":"AnimeDB","url":"http:\/\/anidb.info\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4897"},{"name":"AnimeNewsNetwork","url":"http:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=7492"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Baccano"}]}
