The mother and son depend on each other for life. Because of her passion for selling steamed buns, her mother named her son Maibao. Mai Bao has a round head and a round brain. He likes to show off but is timid, but he is a good boy with a good nature. \u3000\u3000 When King Yang Guangji usurped the throne, the general escorted the princess Yuanzi and Yuxi to flee. In order to cover up, Yuanzi disguised as an ugly girl and came to the school where Mai Bao was located. The two soon became good friends. \u3000\u3000 One day, while my friends were playing, Mai Bao rescued a dragon among the insects, the fire dragon, who spoke human and spiritual. His kindness touched the \"Firefly Dragon\" and guided him to the cave to open the dusty seal of Xiang Yu for a century. Mai Bao opened the seal, awakening Xiang Yu, who had been sleeping for a hundred years, and Mai Bao became the only person who could possess Xiang Yu's soul. It's just that Xiang Yu doesn't like Mai Bao's lack of heroic figure, and Mai Bao has always disagreed with Xiang Yu because of his timidity and fear. \u3000\u3000 And Yang Guang\u2019s minions tracked down the whereabouts of the little princess and Yu Xi, and broke into the small village where Mai Bao was. \u3000\u3000 Xiao Yuanzi\u2019s friend, Xiao Tang Wang, is wit and brave, and is very dissatisfied with Yang Guang\u2019s tyranny, but the strength of the two sides is very different. With the help of Mai Bao, Xiao Yuanzi and their partners, they united and started a battle of wits with Yang Guang. The friends encountered many difficulties and even faced the test of life and death. Wheat Bao kept his mother's teachings in mind, and used Xiang Yu to teach him martial arts like a hero to solve problems for the people and finally won the victory...(translated from douban)","background":"This anime aired in 2007.","premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{"Sequel":[{"mal_id":44666,"type":"anime","name":"Da Tang Fengyun2","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/44666\/Da_Tang_Fengyun2"}]},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"}],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"}],"opening_themes":["No opening themes have been added to this title.
