The second arc is the actual plot from the manga. Usagi bids farewell to Mamoru, who is going to America to study abroad. In his place comes the Three Lights, an idol trio consisting of three boys, Seiya, Taiki, and Yaten. The new enemy is Galaxia, a woman who desires to rule the entire galaxy by collecting the Star Seeds of humans. Three new Senshi appear, the Sailor Starlights, who also intend to stop Galaxia without Sailor Moon's help.","background":null,"premiered":"Spring 1996","broadcast":"Unknown","related":{"Adaptation":[{"mal_id":92,"type":"manga","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/92\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon"}],"Prequel":[{"mal_id":1239,"type":"anime","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon SuperS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1239\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_SuperS"}],"Summary":[{"mal_id":8756,"type":"anime","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Memorial","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/8756\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_Memorial"},{"mal_id":13931,"type":"anime","name":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Sailor Stars - Hero Club","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/13931\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon__Sailor_Stars_-_Hero_Club"}]},"producers":[{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"TV Asahi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/55\/TV_Asahi"},{"mal_id":2292,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Agency","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/2292\/Toei_Agency"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/119\/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Toei Animation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/18\/Toei_Animation"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"themes":[],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.toei-anim.co.jp\/lineup\/tv\/sailor_stars\/"},{"name":"AnimeDB","url":"http:\/\/anidb.info\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2542"},{"name":"AnimeNewsNetwork","url":"http:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=795"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sailor_Moon_Sailor_Stars"}]}
