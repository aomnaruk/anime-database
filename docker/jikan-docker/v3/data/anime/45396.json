What is reflected in the story is the spiritual temperament that all children possess: courage, love, self-denial, trust, and mutual help. What we have seen is the case of U, but we can feel the commonality between children's innocence and childlikeness, and we can see the big from the small. The images of children in this series of short films are cute, healthy, positive and full of truth, goodness and beauty. This film is a public welfare animation short, which is a fun and entertaining film, and conveys positive energy in laughter.(translated from youku)","background":null,"premiered":null,"broadcast":"Unknown","related":{},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"}],"themes":[],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[]}
