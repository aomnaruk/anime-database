It homes in on the daily life of a father with a daughter whose hands and feet are deformed. 2. \"Animal Farm\" relies on the rough-and-ready feel of stop-motion clay animation to create a satire of bullying and mob dynamics. 3. \"At Her House\" paints a devastating picture of gender inequality within a marriage. 4. \"Flesh and Bone\" gently pillories superficiality and the obsession with outward appearance. 5. \"Bicycle Trip\" focuses on the discrimination experienced by foreign workers in Korea. 6. \"Be a Human Being\" looks at the way young Koreans are barely treated as human beings before they get to university.
