Alternatively titled \"Ein\u2019s Summer Vacation,\" the special is paired with the song \"Doggy Dog,\" as performed in English by Seatbelts, responsible for much of the musical score that appears throughout the main anime series. The same track can be found on their album Cowboy Bebop Vitaminless.  In 2013, distributor Anime Limited acquired a home video license for the United Kingdom; Part 1 of the Blu-ray collection was released on July 29, 2013.
