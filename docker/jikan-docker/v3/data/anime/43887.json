He is naturally happy, kind-hearted, likes to be nosy, energetic, very curious about things around him, and has his own unique insights and super imagination. His words and deeds are often shocking. He is crazy about thinking. The biggest feature is that it is delicious. Whenever he mentions exams, he can think of roasted sweet potatoes and lamb skewers. He also observes and imagines it as a delicious tea. In order to have snacks, he can make things that go against his own principles. Things, his cuteness and cleverness make everyone laugh.(translated from douban)","background":"This anime aired in 2013.","premiered":null,"broadcast":"Unknown","related":{"Parent story":[{"mal_id":43881,"type":"anime","name":"Da Erduo Tu Tu Season 1","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/43881\/Da_Erduo_Tu_Tu_Season_1"}]},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"}],"themes":[],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/zh.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E5%A4%A7%E8%80%B3%E6%9C%B5%E5%9B%BE%E5%9B%BE"}]}
