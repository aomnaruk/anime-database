Though the CG was primitive, (the rendering and models aren\u2019t much better than that seen in Resident Evil 2, it\u2019s certainly not on par with Resident Evil 3) it told the story enough.

An Umbrella scientist lost in all the confusion. The UBCS team, consisting of members Rodrigo, Roger, Klaus, Ed and Norman, have a GPS device used to track down Dr. Cameron\u2019s last known location, which is near a large food factory. Upon entering the factory they are attacked by a large creature, a sort of hybrid between a Tyrant and the more evolved forms of Nemesis.
