Police chronicles the tales of Mega-Tokyo's special police division designed to control rogue Boomers in the city. A.D. Police Officer Kenji Sasaki faces a major dilemma: he loses another partner to a rabid boomer. A day after he's sent off-duty, he receives a new partner in the form of German cop Hans Kleif. Funny thing is that Kenji sucker-punched Hans at a bar the night before. Not only does Kenji face the everyday task of controlling Boomers, he has to learn to adjust with his new partner.\u00a0 (Source: ANN)\u00a0","background":null,"premiered":"Spring 1999","broadcast":"Thursdays at 01:45 (JST)","related":{"Character":[{"mal_id":568,"type":"anime","name":"Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/568\/Bubblegum_Crisis_Tokyo_2040"}],"Prequel":[{"mal_id":1346,"type":"anime","name":"AD Police","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1346\/AD_Police"}],"Side story":[{"mal_id":1350,"type":"anime","name":"Parasite Dolls","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1350\/Parasite_Dolls"}]},"producers":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/48\/AIC"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/97\/ADV_Films"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":107,"type":"anime","name":"Plum","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/107\/Plum"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"}],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.anime-int.com\/works\/adpolice\/tv\/index.html"},{"name":"AnimeDB","url":"http:\/\/anidb.info\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=452"},{"name":"AnimeNewsNetwork","url":"http:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=292"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A.D._Police:_To_Protect_and_Serve"}]}
