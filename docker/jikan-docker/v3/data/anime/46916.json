In the \"Bean Realm\" where the nerves and gods are only one-minded, a bean that could have become immortal was treated as a neuropathy by the secular bean, and was sent to the mental bean hospital for treatment, so it became an out-and-out nerve beans. In this maddening mental bean farm, the \"old naughty boy\" has never forgotten his original intention and insisted on monasticism. However, in the eyes of the dean and nurses, the neurosis is just a model of neurosis. In the struggle between the hospital's \"treatment\" and the \"abandonment of treatment\" by the nerve bean, the short film staged scenes of laughter and neurotic stories.
