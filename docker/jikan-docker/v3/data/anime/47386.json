In this season's story, Brooke's rescue story continues. This season, Bruco came to the new base and received the new mission of \"Guardian Star Stone\". In order to promote the execution of the task, Captain Grape gave them the ingot of innovative power. With the help of the energy of the ingot, Bru became an exclusive chariot (Boub-Crimson Lightning, Lulu-Ice Blue Warhammer, Coco- Brilliant Wings), and these tanks also have their own exclusive combat skills. After completing the upgrade of the team, Bruco united and used wisdom and courage to complete the Guardian of the Origin Star Stone. Bruker has also gained a rapid spiritual growth on his journey to become an all-around strike team.
