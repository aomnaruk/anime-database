Therefore, her friends are fascinated by her and are brought into the mysterious world by her story. Mythological stories are priceless wealth and suitable reading materials for every group. Just as the rope entwined with the treasure was slowly untied, mythological stories began to be spread around the world, first through oral transmission, and later some were included in books and became part of traditional culture. However, there are still a lot of stories not known by people. Many stories are still \"sleeping\", waiting to be \"awakened\" by people. They need someone who loves storytelling to bring them into life, and tell these stories to children who simply love to listen to stories. Young people are always willing to see the world with such a perspective between reality and imagination.
