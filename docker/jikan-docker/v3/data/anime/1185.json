(Source: ANN)","background":"Battle Athletes was originally a game concept by Hiroki Hayashi, and produced by AIC Spirits (Not to be confused with AIC Spirits, another AIC division, which focused on animation rather then games). Anime International Company (AIC) would later produce an OVA based on Battle Athletes, and also a TV spin-off Battle Athletes Victory, a series unrelated to the original OVA.","premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{"Adaptation":[{"mal_id":41701,"type":"manga","name":"Battle Athletes Daiundoukai","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/41701\/Battle_Athletes_Daiundoukai"}],"Alternative version":[{"mal_id":1186,"type":"anime","name":"Battle Athletess Daiundoukai (TV)","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1186\/Battle_Athletess_Daiundoukai_TV"}]},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/79\/Genco"},{"mal_id":204,"type":"anime","name":"Pioneer LDC","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/204\/Pioneer_LDC"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/467\/Discotek_Media"},{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1459\/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/48\/AIC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/30\/Sports"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/9\/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"themes":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space"}],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.nbcuni.co.jp\/rondorobe\/anime\/daiunova\/"},{"name":"AnimeDB","url":"http:\/\/anidb.info\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=848"},{"name":"AnimeNewsNetwork","url":"http:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=459"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battle_Athletes#Battle_Athletes"}]}
