There was a severe drought in Chaozhou this year, and the people didn't have a chance to live. One day, Jiao Yugu and grandma Jiao, who lived in the city, were walking outside, and they came across a little white dragon who was practicing as a white turtle and took it home. Huang Batian wants to forcefully marry Yugu, and Bailong helps him. Grandma Jiao begged Bailong to rain to save the people of Chaozhou. Bailong privately dropped heavy rain, violated the rules of heaven, and was fined to the world. Huang Batian designed to frame the white dragon and gain immortality and invincible power. Bailong gave the dragon ball to Yugu and brought it back to the East China Sea. After being infiltrated by sea water, the white dragon was reborn in the dragon ball. In order to avoid the invincible Huang Batian, the Jade Emperor ordered Chaozhou to sink to the bottom. Bailong struggled to deal with the heavenly soldiers, while Yugu and grandma led the people of Yizhou out of Chaozhou City. Finally, the flood flooded the sinking Chaozhou City and Huang Batian into the bottom of the water, turning it into the current Chaohu Lake. Bailong, Yugu and Grandma joined together, and took the people to the distance by boat, and started a new life.(translated from iqiyi)","background":null,"premiered":null,"broadcast":"Unknown","related":{},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"}],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[]}
