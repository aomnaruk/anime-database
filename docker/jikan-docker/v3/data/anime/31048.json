The song is now used for the AR campaign for Rohto Pharmaceutical's new eye drops \"Digi Eye\". Like much of Mitchie's song titles this one has a double meaning, \"ai\" (love) and \"eye\" both being correct translations. An app was released in August 2014 that would play a partial version of the song and show a 3D Miku dancing on any surface.
