It wanted to get the balloon down, but the balloon was too high and had to run with the balloon, hoping that it would land soon. The balloon finally fell, but was picked up by the puppy. Although the bear and the puppy both wanted to play with balloons, they were polite and humble. At this time, the little monkey appeared and could not help but said that they had taken the balloon. \u3000\u3000 The little monkey accidentally hung the balloon on a big tree branch on the edge of the cliff. Seeing this, it turned around and left without saying a word. The bear and puppy were very angry, but they were helpless. Later, the little monkey, puppy, tortoise and little rabbit worked together to remove the balloon, but something unpleasant happened immediately.
