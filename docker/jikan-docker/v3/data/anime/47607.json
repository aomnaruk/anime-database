Lunch is sour! Unexpectedly, in addition to troublesome stars, there are troublesome elements in this world! Troublesome elements are smaller than troublesome stars, so small that they are invisible to the naked eye. Ultra-mini warriors must shrink themselves to one-thousandths before they can enter the nano world to fight against new forms of enemies; trouble elements look innocent, but they can cause damage to the human world. Great trouble, where did they come from, and what purpose do they have? Call the super mini warrior and defeat your troubles!
