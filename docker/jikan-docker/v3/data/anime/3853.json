The Den-O characters are drawn in the style of Shin-chan's regular characters. Another thing of note, inbetween commercial breaks, clips of a live action Shin-Chan onboard the Den-Liner or with characters from the Kamen Rider Den-O Series were shown. In most of these scenes it involves the Owner giving Shin a speech of sorts or making Shin feel uncomfortable.","background":null,"premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{"Parent story":[{"mal_id":966,"type":"anime","name":"Crayon Shin-chan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/966\/Crayon_Shin-chan"}]},"producers":[{"mal_id":55,"type":"anime","name":"TV Asahi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/55\/TV_Asahi"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen"}],"themes":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/31\/Super_Power"}],"opening_themes":["No opening themes have been added to this title.
