The town is located on a piece of the sea. There is a wharf. The wharf is the terminus for the sugar sugar bus. The wharf is where the sugar sugar bus can be parked. It is also the place to buy the ticket for the sugar bus. The sugar sugar bus is the most powerful means of transportation in the town. It can take everyone to any place. The character of the sugar sugar bus also varies with the tickets purchased by the passengers. There is a \"bad boy\" in the small town who loves to make trouble. He likes to eat sweets very much. Once in a while, he accidentally found honey and almonds wrapped in honey and almonds in the hive house where he lived and dried in the sun to get dragees, which were actually very delicious. So he developed all kinds of candies and gave them life. This is the most proud work of the \"bad boys\" in this small town. But these candies don't follow him to do bad things. The angry \"bad boy\" decides to make these candies evil. He also threatens to invent more candies that make children eat bad teeth. But the kind-hearted candies unite, not only to defend themselves, but also to protect the children, so that they can eat healthy and green candies.
