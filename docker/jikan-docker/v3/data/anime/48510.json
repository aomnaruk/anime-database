Drones have played an indispensable and important function in human life. One day, a large meteorite fell on earth, and scientists discovered that it had an infinite source of energy, the \"Cosmo Stone\", and applied it to a drone, what people call a \"space drone.\" One day, drone wars around the world broke out, and space drones were active as a weapon of war.
