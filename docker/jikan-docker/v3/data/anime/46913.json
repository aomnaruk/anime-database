In order to save the world, the top scientist Dr. Tianji extracted the virtue energy from the ancient moral education classic \"Disciple Guidance\", created a magical elf-Afu, and sent it back to collect the virtue energy. Ah Fu returned to 2013 and met Rongzai, who had just started kindergarten, and helped each other with Rongzai and his friends, and successfully collected virtue energy.
