Caused the world's vicissitudes. \u3000\u3000 Kan Jin Zhao was relegated to the mortal world, never detached. Only when he finds out the Xuanyuan Sword that he has not traced, can he have a chance to return to the heavenly court. In order to return to the heavenly court, he only had to work hard. \u3000\u3000 Kan Jin Zhao became a Taoist disciple of the Kunlun School after arriving in the Mortal Realm. \u3000\u3000 Demon Sect can detect Xuanyuan Sword by using Kan Jinzhao's eyeballs. \u3000\u3000Because of possessing Xuanyuan Sword, he can command the world's ghosts and gods. So as to achieve the supreme power of the world. \u3000\u3000 The demons wanted to dominate the world, so they searched for Xuanyuan Sword. To find a sword, you must first get Kan Jinzhao's eyes. \u3000\u3000 Tianshan faction also sent people to catch Kan Jin Zhao. \u3000\u3000 Kunlun faction must protect Kan Jinzhao. \u3000\u3000The contradiction between Kunlun School and Demon Sect is opposite. \u3000\u3000 The Tianshan School and the Kunlun School are detached. Kan Jinzhao fell in love with Yu Huan, the female disciple of the Tianshan School. \u3000\u3000 In many conflicts, many unexpected plots have occurred. At the end of the story, it is not a routine to defeat one faction through form. It is that one faction did not win the fame as expected; and the other faction was not eliminated or defeated. It was they who destroyed themselves. It is their own will that is inherently problematic. \u3000\u3000 It seems that the most useless person got Xuanyuanjian. He has no desire for rights. He just wanted to take responsibility for his mistakes. Therefore, within a single thought, the sea becomes a thorny field again. \u3000\u3000 Maybe, everything can go back to the past. However, the experience is a fact. There is no absolutely perfect thing in the world. The ending is beautiful, but it is also a bit regrettable. It reveals a touch of helplessness and a touch of sadness in life.(translated from douban)","background":"This anime aired in 2009.","premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"}],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[]}
