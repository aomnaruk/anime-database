Right here, seemingly ordinary but fun humorous stories happen every day. Sometimes funny, sometimes bizarre, sometimes romantic, and sometimes touching. Guazi, hot sauce, Dao brother, old school, without exception, they are all people with stories. Together, they use laughter and scolding to convey the life status and values of the new generation of young people; together, they use witty words to create hilarious jokes and sparks of wisdom. \"5 Building No. 32\" brings you four close friends next door, unfolding a hilarious and invincible youth picture.
