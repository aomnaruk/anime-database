As a result, Pan Bai wounded the minister, took away the white cat queen's moon phantom star, and imprisoned her. He used the energy of the phantom star to open the black hole leading to the planet Sembolo, preparing to invade Sembolo. At this time, Sembolo was in peace, Bodhi was riding a skateboard and taking the alien life detector to the mountain top park for experiments. On the way, I ran into a motorcyclist who deliberately played tricks on Bodhi. Bodhi turned them around. The motorcyclist's car almost hit a child, but Bodhi, who responded quickly, saved the child. The drag racing clan couldn't control the car that rushed to the cliff. Bodhi stabilized the speeding car at the very moment, and then drove the speeding car towards the city center. The speeding car was speeding through the buildings in the city center and was about to hit the building. Bodhi Jizhong Shengzhi drove the speeding car to the weightless experience hall on the top floor of the Greentown Science and Technology Museum, avoiding an accident. Afterwards, Bodhi went to the Peak Park on the top of the Green City to conduct experiments. Sure enough, the alien life detector detected the alien race! Although the powerful energy impact caused by this caused the detector to be destroyed. But Bodhi was very happy, because he proved his conjecture-there are indeed alien creatures in this world.(translated from douban)","background":null,"premiered":null,"broadcast":"Unknown","related":{"Sequel":[{"mal_id":45722,"type":"anime","name":"Bao Di Yu Haoyou Di 2 Ji","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/45722\/Bao_Di_Yu_Haoyou_Di_2_Ji"}]},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"}],"themes":[],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[]}
