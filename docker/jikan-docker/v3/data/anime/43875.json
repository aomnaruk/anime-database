But it has attracted a war of aliens competing for the mysterious stone statue. Unprepared Baige Island was suddenly panicked. Under the alien rule at this stage, several people who were enemies are forced to live together on Baige Island. The aliens, under the pretext of finding the heads of their races hidden in the human race, rebelled, and instigated humans to suspect each other and kill. And he acts as a savior, from the face to make mankind surrender spiritually. Under the coercion of force, the ignorant people guillotine their neighbors-\"the rebellion of aliens\". Young Tianwang, bearing the same humiliation, endured the humiliation and went to the realm of Yin and Yang alone to collect the seventh element to deal with aliens. On the way, he experienced life and death hardships, and his soul and body were tortured. Under his leadership, the teenagers fought desperately against evil, reshaping the dignity of mankind with their precious lives and blood.(translated from douban)","background":"This anime aired in 2003.","premiered":null,"broadcast":"Unknown","related":{},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[],"themes":[],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/zh.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E7%99%BD%E9%B8%BD%E5%B2%9B"}]}
