This time, Little Pig becomes the protagonist of the series of animations. He is a kind pig, but his cleverness often backfires and makes all kinds of jokes. This film is a fine work of paper-cut animation. The lively paper-cut characters vividly show the characteristics of various small animals. At the same time, the anthropomorphic character is very dramatic. The whole animation is relaxed and interesting, which is the favorite of children.(translated from douban)","background":"This anime aired in 1998.","premiered":null,"broadcast":"Unknown","related":{},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life"},{"mal_id":30,"type":"anime","name":"Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/30\/Sports"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/41\/Suspense"},{"mal_id":9,"type":"anime","name":"Ecchi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/9\/Ecchi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"},{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen"},{"mal_id":25,"type":"anime","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"},{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/19\/Music"},{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"opening_themes":["No opening themes have been added to this title.
