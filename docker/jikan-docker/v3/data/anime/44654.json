The tortoise was so weak that it bit off a few feathers of the egret. The egret pecks the turtle angrily, but the tortoise retracts its head and tail hands and feet into the hard shell, unable to peck. The egret flips and pecks in every possible way, but it can't hurt the turtle. The tortoise braked with silence, waited for work with ease, seized the opportunity to bite the egret's neck, and cleverly won this protracted battle.
