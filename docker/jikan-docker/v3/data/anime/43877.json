Fortunately, he was rescued and taken in by a monk who had escaped from the world. With the monk, Di Qing learned a martial art. Eight years later, Di Qing, who had no attachment to Hong Chen, wanted to cut his hair and become a monk, but was stopped by the monk. Under the monks' persuasion, Di Qing returned to Tokyo and joined the team to defend his family and the country. Di Qing, who was full of justice, went to the government to surrender because he injured the arrogant emperor Sun Yi. He met Lord Bao and Prince Zheng, who were observant of Qihao. With the help of the two, Di Qing was freed from the crime and was left by Prince Zheng Be a bodyguard. In the subsequent twists and turns, Di Qing learned how to use wisdom instead of relying on force to solve problems. After bidding farewell to Prince Zheng, Di Qing went to the border and became a subordinate of the female general Yang Paifeng. In the days and nights spent together, Di Qing and Yang Paifeng had a great love between them.(translated from douban)","background":"This anime aired in 2003.","premiered":null,"broadcast":"Unknown","related":{},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"}],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"}],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[]}
