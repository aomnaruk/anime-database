Their goals are unknown, and they cast a dark shadow over the world. Though few people believe in the Bresdo's existence, one American journalist named Lucie Davenport heads to Texas to contact a certain family, and she meets the cyborgs. The cyborgs themselves have been freed from their duty of protecting humanity ever since the establishment of the UN Guardian troops, and they now live quiet lives of peace.","background":null,"premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{"Adaptation":[{"mal_id":1639,"type":"manga","name":"Cyborg 009","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1639\/Cyborg_009"},{"mal_id":126480,"type":"manga","name":"Cyborg 009: Call of Justice","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/126480\/Cyborg_009__Call_of_Justice"}],"Alternative version":[{"mal_id":1678,"type":"anime","name":"Cyborg 009: The Cyborg Soldier","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1678\/Cyborg_009__The_Cyborg_Soldier"},{"mal_id":4690,"type":"anime","name":"Cyborg 009 (1979)","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/4690\/Cyborg_009_1979"},{"mal_id":8394,"type":"anime","name":"Cyborg 009 (TV)","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/8394\/Cyborg_009_TV"}],"Prequel":[{"mal_id":11755,"type":"anime","name":"009 Re:Cyborg","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/11755\/009_Re_Cyborg"}],"Sequel":[{"mal_id":33686,"type":"anime","name":"Cyborg 009: Call of Justice 2","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/33686\/Cyborg_009__Call_of_Justice_2"}]},"producers":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/10\/Production_IG"},{"mal_id":1561,"type":"anime","name":"Ishimori Pro","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1561\/Ishimori_Pro"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1231,"type":"anime","name":"OLM Digital","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1231\/OLM_Digital"},{"mal_id":1278,"type":"anime","name":"Signal.MD","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1278\/SignalMD"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"}],"opening_themes":["No opening themes have been added to this title.
