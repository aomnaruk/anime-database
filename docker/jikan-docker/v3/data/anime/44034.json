After both parties paid a painful price, Mars and the Earth terminated all exchanges and opened a brief peace. In the Zero War era, in addition to the threat of Mars, space pirates composed of lunar criminals became increasingly rampant. A hundred years of peace ended in 2588. When a new type of influenza H1Z1 broke out in the lunar city state and was helpless, Mars, which had been isolated for a long time, showed goodwill and sent a medical ship to the moon for humanitarian rescue. Unexpectedly, this false aid turned out to be the beginning of the offensive. The lunar city-state army retreated steadily, and the gravitational ring fell one after another. The Lunar Army relied on the secret weapon of the moon\u2014Kaineng\u2019s power to withstand the aggressive attacks of space pirates and successfully defended the territory. Although the sacrifice was great, he still survived the crisis of being broken. In 2589, the Mars Army made a comeback ignoring the armistice agreement and launched an attack on the United Nations Association with the Earth. The Lunar Army sent a Kaineng force to support the Earth Army. The battle fell into a fierce state of stalemate, and the space pirates, the moon city-states, and the earth were pushed to face a cruel battle of death.(translated from douban)","background":"This anime aired in 2015.","premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{"Parent story":[{"mal_id":44032,"type":"anime","name":"Chao Xian Lie Bing-kai Neng","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/44032\/Chao_Xian_Lie_Bing-kai_Neng"}]},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":38,"type":"anime","name":"Military","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/38\/Military"}],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/zh.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E8%B6%85%E9%99%90%E7%8D%B5%E5%85%B5-%E5%87%B1%E8%83%BD"}]}
