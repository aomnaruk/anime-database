Unfortunately for Riki, he`s the doppleganger in our world of Byoudo, Master of the Dark Realm, and when a dimensional gate opens between the two worlds, the evil Fairy Master tricks Byoudo into making an attempt to conquer our beautiful, and better lit, world. Now poor Riki is semi-possessed by his opposite number, and the minions of the Fairy Master are mutating his classmates into hideous lustful monsters. To make matters worse, all the inter-dimensional commotion has attracted the attention of a sword-happy exorcist and the heroic Zankan of the Space-Time Police! Which all means that Riki is about to take one bitch of a mid-term. The course is survival, and forget \"Pass\/Fail\". The test is graded \"Live\/Die\".","background":null,"premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{"Adaptation":[{"mal_id":111937,"type":"manga","name":"Majinden","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/111937\/Majinden"}]},"producers":[{"mal_id":382,"type":"anime","name":"Tokuma Shoten","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/382\/Tokuma_Shoten"},{"mal_id":567,"type":"anime","name":"D.A.S.T.","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/567\/DAST"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":310,"type":"anime","name":"AnimEigo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/310\/AnimEigo"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":48,"type":"anime","name":"AIC","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/48\/AIC"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Horror","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/14\/Horror"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Demons","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/6\/Demons"},{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Martial Arts","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/17\/Martial_Arts"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/31\/Super_Power"}],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[{"name":"AnimeDB","url":"http:\/\/anidb.info\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1462"},{"name":"AnimeNewsNetwork","url":"http:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=521"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battle_Royal_High_School"}]}
