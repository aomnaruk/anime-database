The young flying fish Kevin (voiced by Li Junyu) has been selected by his father as the head fish of the next generation. He dreams of one day leading the whole family to Barbados, the hometown of Flying Fish. After a quarrel, he impulsively ventured to challenge the fishing area of humans. Unfortunately, he was arrested and went to the fish tank of a restaurant in Chinatown. The whereabouts of the family's ancestral pearls are also unknown. In the restaurant, Kevin met the restaurant owner's son Xiaobao (voiced by Lin Ying), a Chinese kid who seemed introverted and silent but loved adventure in his heart. His father, Dabao, forces him to practice cooking every day, so as to meet the challenges of his competitors with malicious intent, or to take over the family class in the future. The two knew each other and gained friendship.
