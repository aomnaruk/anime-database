The little Godzilla appears despondent and upset. Daddy Godzilla and his offspring have a heart-to-heart over tea where the smaller monster expresses concerns over their gender identity. Using no dialogue, the short illustrates that while the little Godzilla may have been born as male (AMAB), she is a girl. Godzilla responds with acceptance, mirroring how parents can support their trans children.
