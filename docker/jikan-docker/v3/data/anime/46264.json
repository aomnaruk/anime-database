In order to get rid of this \"honorary title\", she bought a \"smart pet egg\" from the Internet that can make people smart. But after I bought it, I found out that this little egg was stupid than Tangtang himself, and he couldn't even speak enough. It needed the owner to develop his own intelligence to use it. Tangtang got angry and named it Benben. Later, Tangtang gradually grew up in the process of developing intelligence for it, and she has long since gotten rid of the title of \"little idiot\"! Since then, Benben has been by Tangtang's side, and Tangtang finally understands that growing up is such a happy thing.(translated from youku)","background":null,"premiered":null,"broadcast":"Unknown","related":{"Sequel":[{"mal_id":46265,"type":"anime","name":"Congming Chongwu Dan Zhi Qihuan Lucheng","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/46265\/Congming_Chongwu_Dan_Zhi_Qihuan_Lucheng"}]},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"}],"themes":[],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[]}
