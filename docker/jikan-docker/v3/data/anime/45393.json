But the careless doctor forgot the password to open the cabin. The radish cannot stay in the nutrition cabin for a long time, it must be taken out within 30 days. Another way to open the nutrition cabin is to complete the phantom mirror mission. Therefore, the doctor handed over this task to U and his friends Fat Tsai, A Mei and the man-in-law. But the three rabbits headed by Tu Fei had long been salivating on the turnips, and they snatched the phantom mirror. In order to open the nutrition cabin to get the carrot before the rabbit, the doctor gave U and the others another phantom mirror. The children and the rabbits opened the magic mirror and kept getting the task guidance: decrypt the pinyin of Chinese characters to get the location of the next task; search for the jigsaw puzzle to get the location of the next task; complete the English letter connection to get the location of the next task... The rabbits will make trouble when U is doing task analysis. U also relies on his own ingenuity to defeat the rabbit. As a result, a humorous competition was staged.
