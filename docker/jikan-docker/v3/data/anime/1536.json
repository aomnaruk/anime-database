Tokiko Tsumura, the girl he saved, explains that the monster is a homunculus. Kazuki had been attacked and killed by it when he was rescuing her; however, she, feeling responsible for him, revived him by placing a Kakugane medallion in his chest, serving as a replacement heart. The Kakugane, as Tokiko explains, is an alchemical device that, when activated, takes a certain form based on the Kakugane's user, forming a unique Buso Renkin. The Buso Renkin is the only thing that can destroy a homunculus monster. Using this, Kazuki creates his own Buso Renkin (the \"Sunlight Heart,\" a huge lance). Along with Tokiko and her own Buso Renkin (the \"Valkyrie Skirt,\" an execution scythe), Kazuki joins the fight against the homunculi and their master.","background":null,"premiered":"Fall 2006","broadcast":"Thursdays at 01:00 (JST)","related":{"Adaptation":[{"mal_id":41,"type":"manga","name":"Busou Renkin","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/41\/Busou_Renkin"}],"Other":[{"mal_id":39316,"type":"anime","name":"Busou Renkin: Mahiro no Busou Renkin Kouza","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/39316\/Busou_Renkin__Mahiro_no_Busou_Renkin_Kouza"}]},"producers":[{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Universal Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/31\/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"},{"mal_id":127,"type":"anime","name":"Yomiko Advertising","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/127\/Yomiko_Advertising"},{"mal_id":1365,"type":"anime","name":"Shueisha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1365\/Shueisha"},{"mal_id":2135,"type":"anime","name":"Imagine","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/2135\/Imagine"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":119,"type":"anime","name":"VIZ Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/119\/VIZ_Media"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Xebec","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/27\/Xebec"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Fantasy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/10\/Fantasy"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/23\/School"}],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.busourenkin.com\/"},{"name":"AnimeDB","url":"http:\/\/anidb.info\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4516"},{"name":"AnimeNewsNetwork","url":"http:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=6601"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Buso_Renkin"}]}
