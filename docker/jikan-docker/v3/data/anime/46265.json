But after I bought it, I found out that this little egg was stupid than Tangtang himself, and he couldn't even speak enough. It needed the owner to develop his own intelligence to use it. Tangtang got angry and named it Benben, and since then, he and Benben have embarked on a long road of growth. Finally, with the help of Tangtang and his brother, Benben finally activated the intelligence program and became a real smart pet egg. The animation also adopts the very popular way of explaining interesting little knowledge in today's TV shows, introducing a little interesting knowledge related to the story, enriching the content of the film, and expanding the audience's knowledge, so that it can be entertained at the same time. ..
