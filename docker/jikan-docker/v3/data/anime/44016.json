The fried chicken shop opened by father Chen Weilin has been steadily rising since it was named \"Bombing Chicken\". They moved out of their old house and bought a new house in the suburbs. Xiao Di also has her own bedroom, so she doesn't need to live in the same room with her sister. Dad also bought a QQ car for transportation. This QQ car has the dual functions of a passenger car and a truck. \u3000\u3000The new home is far away from the city, and Da Di has to squeeze the subway to go to work every day during peak hours. To work in the company, Da Di must act like a desperate Saburo in order not to be fired. Fortunately, she met Ma Linshu who was an actress in a puppet theater. The two fell in love at first sight, but Da Di was too busy to date. \u3000\u3000 Ma Linshu, as a small actor who is similar to a freelancer, always has a lot of free time. He happily comes to Daddy for a date every time, but any phone call from Daddy\u2019s boss, client or even colleague will make the appointment ruin. After finally getting through the weekend, Ma Linshu felt that he finally had time! But for Da Di on weekends, it is a rare time to make up for sleep! \u3000\u3000 Mom\u2019s biggest interest was playing mahjong and perming her hair. But since Ma Linshu appeared, her mother has found a new joy in life-beating a mandarin duck. My mother said to Da Di: Ma Linshu is a person who spends half of his life suffering from gains and losses, and half of his life. \u3000\u3000 The love path of this little couple has just begun, and it is already in danger. \u3000\u3000 Xiaodi went to junior high school and still had poor grades. She is always confused and lazy. She often forgets to do her homework on time, but can always remember the number of snacks at home. \u3000\u3000Daddy is still busy \"bombing chicken\", busy writing his poems, and worrying that no one appreciates it. \u3000\u3000 Everyone in the family seems to be extremely busy, but grandma too often stays at home alone, very lonely. She hoped that they could spend more time with her, but she felt sorry for them and didn't want to take up their few rest time. \u3000\u3000 Grandma Tai wrote to her sister Furong in order to eliminate loneliness. She did not find a suitable letterhead, so she wrote on the back of an old calendar. The front of the calendar is a photo of \"Shenzhou VII\". \u3000\u3000Furong\u2019s great-grandson Haohao is pestering her to ask where her parents are? It turned out that Haohao's parents divorced and fostered him at the grandmother's house. Grandma Tai is unwilling to hurt Haohao, and every day she makes up a beautiful lie to deal with Haohao. Just when she was racking her brains, the doorbell rang, and she opened the door and saw the postman standing outside, with a letter for her to sign. Grandma Haohaotai said: This is a letter from your father. Haohao looked forward to seeing Grandma Tai open the envelope. He saw the picture of \"Shenzhou VII\" and said: Wow! Does my father live in such an impressive house? \u3000\u3000 Haohao kept this matter in his mind and asked his grandma a lot about outer space. It didn't take long for him to start looking for his father. Haohao asked Grandma Tai, is the address on the envelope where Dad lives? Grandma too said yes. Haohao didn't tell her grandma to put on his pet-a cat that looked like a pig, and got on the train to find his father. \u3000\u3000 A few days later, he knocked on the door of the Chen family. Too grandma opened the door, but Xiao Di was stunned, because Haohao's first sentence was: Is this the landing module of \"Shenzhou Seven\"? The Chen family was in a mess with a strange child who was full of spaceships in outer space. Grandma too learned of the situation from Furong, so the whole family held a meeting to study the matter. Grandma Tai insisted on keeping Haohao, but her family members opposed it. But when they learned that Haohao's parents had divorced, they decided to keep him. In this way, Haohao began his life in the Chen family. \u3000\u3000 A few days after Haohao moved in, his mother took Haohao to the school. But because Haohao was too eccentric, he was always dropped out of school. In a short time, Haohao was on the blacklist for admission to this district. In desperation, Haohao had no choice but to go to a private primary school-Baihua Primary School. Baihua Primary School was rented by the principal at a low price in an old teaching building inside Xiaodi School. The principal and Hao Hao hit it off right away, and felt that he had the style of his childhood, so he readily accepted Hao Hao. \u3000\u3000 Haohao became Xiao Di's alumnus, but Xiao Di disdain to admit that he has a younger brother who goes to school in a dilapidated old building. Xiao Di always said that I am different from you, and I went to school in the new shiny golden building. Haohao didn't care about her, so he looked for her sister when it was time to look for her, which caused a lot of trouble to Xiao Di who was afraid of trouble and lazy. But once Haohao had difficulties, Xiao Di would still come forward. \u3000\u3000 There is a transfer student Xiao Xiaochao in Xiaodi\u2019s class. Xiaodi sees Xiaochao thin and thinks that Xiaochao\u2019s family is very poor. She brought a fried chicken drumstick to Xiao Xiaochao every day and told him that it was free! One day, Xiao Xiaochao did not come to class. Xiao Di was worried about whether Xiao Xiaochao was sick because of hunger, but suddenly heard the rumbling outside the classroom, and the classmates outside screamed. Xiao Di took a closer look and found that Xiao Xiaochao came to school in a helicopter! On the opposite side of Dad\u2019s \"Bombing Chicken\" shop, a new opponent called \"Battle Chicken\" came; Mom secretly rented her garage to someone else as a warehouse; Da Di\u2019s boyfriend Ma Linshu unexpectedly became popular, and Da Di\u2019s Happy and worried; Xiao Di, who has always been only interested in eating and sleeping, has recently suddenly become diligent and beautiful. It turns out that the most innocent feelings for Xiao Chao have sprouted in a small heart; and Hao Hao and Grandma are the oldest The little hearts are getting closer and closer, as close as grandchildren... \u3000\u3000 What other unexpected stories happened in the Chen family?
