Kuku, Eins, Boo, Wordy, and Kuku sister Meimei are all naive babies. They live a very happy life in BB City. But the sloppy garbage king who also lives in BB City leads the garbage soldiers he created to often destroy, in an attempt to make the city like the garbage dump they live in, and become their garbage city. The babies were determined to jointly defend BB city, so the city field platoon was established. When the sloppy destroys, the field platoon will inevitably appear, and use their courage and wisdom to fight the sloppy. After a contest between the two sides, each field platoon successfully defeated the sloppy and restored BB City to a clean environment. However, the sloppy still did not give up, and would make a comeback every time, creating new distinctive garbage soldiers, so the urban field platoon took new actions.(translated from iqiyi)","background":null,"premiered":null,"broadcast":"Unknown","related":{},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[],"themes":[],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[]}
