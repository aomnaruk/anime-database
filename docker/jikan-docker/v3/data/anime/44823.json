This year, as the patriarch of the Nanglu clan, Habu, in order to protect the clan, he blocked the Great Demon by himself, but was unfortunately taken away by the Great Demon. The brand-new Great Demon King claimed that if the Nanglu tribe did not exchange them for new young men, they would eat Habu. Bei Luling (voiced by Ji Guanlin) used Tana's grandmother to give her magic power to summon a boy from another world, intending to use this boy as food for the Great Demon in exchange for her father. And the legend of the great demon king in the Nanlu clan is exactly the trial that the next patriarch must go through. Beiluling successfully completed the trial and became the new warrior of the clan, inheriting the responsibility of her father to continue to protect the clan. The whole incident was over, and the Nanlu people returned to their former calm. Li Zhiyu (voiced by Jiang Guangtao), who also learned to be strong during the adventure, also returned to his own world. Both young people have truly matured in this incident.(translated from douban)","background":null,"premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"}],"themes":[],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[]}
