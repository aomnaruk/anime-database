He soon comes upon a whole forest full of \"useless animals\"-- that is, animals that don't live up to their species' usual character. After a short fight with the smoking, bad-tempered rabbit, Usahara, Uruno decides that he wants to move on... but changes his mind upon meeting Chiiko, a clumsy cheetah girl. It's love at first sight for Uruno, and after deciding to stay for her, he continues to hope that even though he's a good-for-nothing, he'll win her over someday. That is, if living with the other strange residents of the forest-- including the aformentioned smoking rabbit, a sake-drinking unicorn, a near-sighted eagle, an orca that cannot swim, and a shy pegasus --doesn't get to him first.","background":null,"premiered":"Winter 2005","broadcast":"Unknown","related":{"Adaptation":[{"mal_id":4828,"type":"manga","name":"Damekko Doubutsu","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/4828\/Damekko_Doubutsu"}]},"producers":[{"mal_id":147,"type":"anime","name":"SKY Perfect Well Think","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/147\/SKY_Perfect_Well_Think"},{"mal_id":158,"type":"anime","name":"Kids Station","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/158\/Kids_Station"},{"mal_id":332,"type":"anime","name":"Takeshobo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/332\/Takeshobo"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":207,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Bus","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/207\/Magic_Bus"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[],"themes":[],"opening_themes":["Sekai de Ichiban Boku ga Suki! by Ryoko Shintani"],"ending_themes":["Life is Free by Ryoko Shintani"],"external_links":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/www.kids-station.com\/minisite\/damekko\/"},{"name":"AnimeDB","url":"http:\/\/anidb.info\/perl-bin\/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2824"},{"name":"AnimeNewsNetwork","url":"http:\/\/www.animenewsnetwork.com\/encyclopedia\/anime.php?id=4994"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Damekko_D%C5%8Dbutsu"}]}
