At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the first railway appeared in our country. After hearing the news, Cixi immediately decided to take a train to inspect various places, so everyone decorated the train according to the rules of the Chinese dynasty. But on the train, Cixi dreamed of a mutiny in the capital, so he hurried back to the court. After returning to Beijing, Cixi felt that the train was not auspicious and was not as comfortable as a sedan chair, so she ordered the train to be driven as far as possible from the capital. The film shows the incompetence of the late Qing government through Cixi's attitude towards trains.(translated from douban)","background":"This anime aired in 1991.The film won the second prize of the second National Film and Television Animation Exhibition.","premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":15,"type":"anime","name":"Kids","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/15\/Kids"}],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"}],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[]}
