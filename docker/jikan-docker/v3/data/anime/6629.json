One day, while bargain shopping, she wins the lucky ticket at a lottery for a one-person trip to Hawaii. Chaos reigns as her family, the Beach's, fight over who should go. The ticket is lost in a bonfire, ironically. Other circumstances follow when the family finds out that the travel agency offered to \"give the equal amount of half the travel expenses in cash for the ticket\" from an employee of the supermarket Asahi had shopped at.
