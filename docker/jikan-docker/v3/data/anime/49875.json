Cosmo Samurai, the ninth Toonami T.I.E., was announced on January 30, 2021, through a promo during the Toonami broadcast. Unlike all previous T.I.E.s (except IGPX) which are animated in 3-D using CGI, Cosmo Samurai is animated in 2-D in an anime art style.","background":"This was Toonami's first non-canonical T.I.E., meaning it features the Toonami characters (i.e. TOM and SARA) but does not impact the ongoing Toonami narrative or the characters themselves. The event is directed by Toshiyuki Tsuru and animated by Telecom. All dialogue in the T.I.E. is spoken in Japanese with English subtitles, similar to the April Fools 2018 broadcast.","premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{},"producers":[],"licensors":[],"studios":[],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"},{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Samurai","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/21\/Samurai"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space"}],"opening_themes":["No opening themes have been added to this title.
