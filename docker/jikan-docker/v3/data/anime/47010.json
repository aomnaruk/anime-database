A sudden strange wind made the originally happy children lose their smiles, and the atmosphere in the park became cold. At the same time, many children disappeared inexplicably, including Feifei. On the other side, Ningning was almost attacked by a dark shadow. Fortunately, he was rescued by Xiao Yun, who claimed to be a defender, and learned from Xiao Yun that Feifei was caught in another dimension by a monster who specializes in absorbing happiness. The time over there is different from here. Even after going for a long time, when I came back, it was the same as when I left. Ningning wanted to rescue Feifei, so she followed Xiao Yun on a strange journey to find Feifei. I learned a lot of precious things along the way. While growing up physically and mentally, I not only met two good friends, Xian Pipi and Xiao Lingxian, but also made many interesting happy gods. With the continuous efforts of several friends, they defeated the monster, rescued Feifei and other children, and finally returned everything to normal.
