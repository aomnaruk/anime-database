Anime's first documentary variety show challenging how far two virtual idols are able to grow!!! It's a live broadcast, so what will happen is unknown!

(Source: Official Website)","background":"A CG comedy virtual idol anime following the footsteps of Minarai Diva, and part of the same VIRTUAL IDOL PROJECT, Heart Algorhythm has the same quirky comedic formula with a slightly different balance towards scripted content and music. Using motion capture on the main seiyuu, Suzuki Minori and Iwai Emiri, 3D animation is subsequently created based on motion data to facilitate the actors' movements, particularly during ad-lib scenes. The series appears to be a collaborative effort between Japanese and Chinese talents, and the characters in the anime speak either Japanese or Chinese. The show was broadcast simultaneously on Nico Nico Douga and Migu Dongman, and on bilibili later, and can still be found there.","premiered":null,"broadcast":null,"related":{"Side story":[{"mal_id":23375,"type":"anime","name":"Minarai Diva","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/23375\/Minarai_Diva"}],"Sequel":[{"mal_id":38018,"type":"anime","name":"Chokkan \u00d7 Algorhythm\u266a 2nd Season","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/38018\/Chokkan_\u00d7_Algorhythm\u266a_2nd_Season"}]},"producers":[{"mal_id":1011,"type":"anime","name":"Warner Music Japan","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1011\/Warner_Music_Japan"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":1910,"type":"anime","name":"Sega Interactive","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1910\/Sega_Interactive"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"}],"explicit_genres":[],"demographics":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":19,"type":"anime","name":"Music","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/19\/Music"}],"opening_themes":[],"ending_themes":[],"external_links":[{"name":"Official Site","url":"http:\/\/project-algorhythm.com\/archive\/"},{"name":"Wikipedia","url":"http:\/\/ja.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%E7%94%9F%E6%94%BE%E9%80%81%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1_%E7%9B%B4%E6%84%9F%C3%97%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B4%E3%83%AA%E3%82%BA%E3%83%A0%E2%99%AA"}]}
