He has always longed for a peaceful country without war-a beautiful country. Although Jin Bao is often laughed at by others, he still believes in it. One day, Liang Guo\u2019s barracks were attacked by an enemy country. Jin Bao was forced to fall into the abyss in order to escape the enemy\u2019s soldiers. Jin Bao, who knew he was inevitable, still hoped to go to the beautiful country before he died. At this moment, his grandfather sent him away. His necklace suddenly shined a strong light, allowing Jin Bao to travel through time and space to an unknown magical country, that is, the beautiful country he has been thinking about day and night. However, the beautiful country in front of him is not as beautiful and peaceful as Jin Bao imagined. It has been invaded by the evil king. Jinbao turned into a panda when he came to the beautiful country. It was even misunderstood by Feitianzhu, a scout from the Anti-Magic Army, that he was the panda hero who saved the beautiful country. Jin Bao, who couldn't figure it out, followed the Flying Pig on the road. On the way, Jin Bao met Guai Li Mantis, Onion Dog, Ginseng Elf, Charcoal, and Seven Little Fortunes. Everyone became Jin Bao's companions. Later, Jinbao finally met the Lion King, the leader of the Anti-Magic Army. \u3000\u3000 Jinbao learned from the Lion King that his grandfather was the panda brave who saved the beautiful country back then, so he made up his mind to inherit his grandfather\u2019s will and vowed to rescue the white dragon princess from the demon king and restore peace to the beautiful country. Jin Bao grew rapidly under the arduous training of the Lion King, and led several anti-magic warriors including the Seven Little Fortunes to march towards the devil's mobile castle. After numerous obstacles, Jin Bao and others overcame all kinds of difficulties, and finally came to the front of the Ten Thousand Demon King Hydra. Under the leadership of Jinbao, everyone united and finally worked together to defeat the Hydra and successfully rescued the White Dragon Princess, allowing the beautiful country to restore its former peace.
